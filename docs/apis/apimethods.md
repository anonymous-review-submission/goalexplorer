{: .no_toc }

The basic analysis of both Screen Builder and Inter-Component Analyzer involves scanning the reachable methods from lifecycle methods and/or callback methods of each activity/fragment in the call graph, to identify fragment transaction methods, menu/drawer/dialog creation methods, or inter-component communication methods.


This page provides a list of these methods collected from [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/).
